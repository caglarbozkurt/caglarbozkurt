### Hey 👋
Çağlar here, amazed by the weird stuff people create on the internet daily. Currently working as a Product Manager at GitHub and enjoying the okayish weather in Berlin - where it's not great in winter, but I can't say it's terrible _auch_.

Here are some things that I'm currently looking into:

- 🐙 Working on a fun side project called [brb](https://brb.wtf/), a mobile game engine with social elements.
- 📚 Actively reading. In case you wonder what I read, check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42086146-a-lar-bozkurt).
- 🍕 Wondering what makes a pizza a pizza or what makes a burger a burger? Can we count rectangular pizzas as pizzas, or can vegan burgers really be burgers? Where do we set the limits when we're defining those dishes? If it's not the ingredients or the shape, how do we instinctively know what a dish is?
